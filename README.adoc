= PlantUML Alternative Docs

== Updating the docs from alphadoc

This project uses link:http://alphadoc.plantuml.com/toc/asciidoc/en[PlantUML's alphadoc] as a source of truth.

To fetch the latest docs from alphadoc, `sync-docs` workflow should be manually triggered by
 going to the link:../../actions/workflows/sync-docs.yml[actions page] or calling it via API.
It automatically creates a PR with the updated docs.
