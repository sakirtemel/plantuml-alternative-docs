== Gantt Diagram

The Gantt is described in __natural__ language, using very simple sentences (subject-verb-complement).


== Declaring tasks

Tasks defined using square bracket. 

=== Duration

Their durations are defined using the `+last+` verb:

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
-- All example --
[Task 1 (1 day)] lasts 1 day
[T2 (5 days)] lasts 5 days
[T3 (1 week)] lasts 1 week
[T4 (1 week and 4 days)] lasts 1 week and 4 days
[T5 (2 weeks)] lasts 2 weeks
@endgantt
</plantuml>

A week is a synonym for how many non-closed days are in a week. So if you specify Saturday and Sunday as closed, a week will be equivalent to 5 days

=== Start

Their beginning are defined using the `+start+` verb:

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days

Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16
@endgantt
</plantuml>
<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days

[Prototype design] starts D+0
[Test prototype] starts D+15
@endgantt
</plantuml>

__[Ref. for `+D+nn+` form: https://forum.plantuml.net/14494/is-it-possible-to-color-the-days-in-the-default-gantt-diagram?show=14550#c14550[QA-14494]]__

=== End

Their ending are defined using the `+end+` verb:

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days

Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] ends 2020-07-25
@endgantt
</plantuml>
<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days

[Prototype design] ends D+14
[Test prototype] ends D+24
@endgantt
</plantuml>
=== Start/End

It is possible to define both absolutely, by specifying dates:
<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16
[Prototype design] ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] ends 2020-07-25

@endgantt
</plantuml>
<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] starts D+0
[Test prototype] starts D+15
[Prototype design] ends D+14
[Test prototype] ends D+24
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== One-line declaration (with the and conjunction)

It is possible to combine declaration on one line with the `+and+` conjunction.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01 and ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16 and lasts 10 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Adding constraints
It is possible to add constraints between tasks.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 10 days
[Code prototype] lasts 10 days
[Write tests] lasts 5 days
[Code prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] starts at [Code prototype]'s start
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Short names
It is possible to define short name for tasks with the `+as+` keyword.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] as [D] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] as [T] lasts 10 days
[T] starts at [D]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Customize colors
It is also possible to customize link::color[colors] with `+is colored in+`.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 13 days
[Test prototype] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] is colored in Fuchsia/FireBrick
[Test prototype] is colored in GreenYellow/Green
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Completion status
=== Adding completion depending percentage
You can set the completion status of a task, by the command:
* `+is xx% completed+`
* `+is xx% complete+` 

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[foo] lasts 21 days
[foo] is 40% completed
[bar] lasts 30 days and is 10% complete
@endgantt
</plantuml>

=== Change colour of completion (by style)

<plantuml>
@startgantt

<style>
ganttDiagram {
  task {
    BackGroundColor GreenYellow
    LineColor Green 
    unstarted {
      BackGroundColor Fuchsia 
      LineColor FireBrick
    }
  }
}
</style>

[Prototype design] lasts 7 days
[Test prototype 0] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 10] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 20] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 30] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 40] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 50] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 60] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 70] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 80] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 90] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype 100] lasts 4 days

[Test prototype 0] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 10] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 20] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 30] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 40] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 50] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 60] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 70] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 80] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 90] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 100] starts at [Prototype design]'s end

[Test prototype 0] is 0% complete
[Test prototype 10] is 10% complete
[Test prototype 20] is 20% complete
[Test prototype 30] is 30% complete
[Test prototype 40] is 40% complete
[Test prototype 50] is 50% complete
[Test prototype 60] is 60% complete
[Test prototype 70] is 70% complete
[Test prototype 80] is 80% complete
[Test prototype 90] is 90% complete
[Test prototype 100] is 100% complete

== Milestone
You can define Milestones using the `+happen+` verb.

=== Relative milestone (use of constraints)
<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Prototype completed] happens at [Test prototype]'s end
[Setup assembly line] lasts 12 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>

=== Absolute milestone (use of fixed date)
<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Prototype completed] happens 2020-07-10
[Setup assembly line] lasts 12 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>


=== Milestone of maximum end of tasks
<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Task1] lasts 4 days
then [Task1.1] lasts 4 days
[Task1.2] starts at [Task1]'s end and lasts 7 days

[Task2] lasts 5 days
then [Task2.1] lasts 4 days

[MaxTaskEnd] happens at [Task1.1]'s end
[MaxTaskEnd] happens at [Task1.2]'s end
[MaxTaskEnd] happens at [Task2.1]'s end

@endgantt
</plantuml>
__[Ref. https://forum.plantuml.net/10764/gantt-multiple-tasks-as-prerequisite-for-a-milestone[QA-10764]]__


== Hyperlinks
You can add hyperlinks to tasks.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[task1] lasts 10 days
[task1] links to [[http://plantuml.com]]
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Calendar
You can specify a starting date for the whole project. By default, the first task starts at this date.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts the 20th of september 2017
[Prototype design] as [TASK1] lasts 13 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Coloring days

It is possible to add link::color[colors] to some days.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts the 2020/09/01 

2020/09/07 is colored in salmon
2020/09/13 to 2020/09/16 are colored in lightblue

[Prototype design] as [TASK1] lasts 22 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
[Prototype completed] happens at [TASK1]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Changing scale
You can change scale for very long project, with one of those parameters:
* printscale
* ganttscale
* projectscale
and one of the values:
* daily __(by default)__
* weekly
* monthly
* quarterly
* yearly

@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Close day
It is possible to close some day.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
project starts the 2018/04/09
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
2018/05/01 is closed
2018/04/17 to 2018/04/19 is closed
[Prototype design] lasts 14 days
[Test prototype] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] is colored in Fuchsia/FireBrick
[Test prototype] is colored in GreenYellow/Green
@endgantt
</plantuml>


Then it is possible to open some closed day.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
2020-07-07 to 2020-07-17 is closed
2020-07-13 is open

Project starts the 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] lasts 10 days
Then [Test prototype] lasts 10 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Definition of a week depending of closed days

A **week** is a synonym for how many non-closed days are in a week, as:
<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts 2021-03-29
[Review 01] happens at 2021-03-29
[Review 02 - 3 weeks] happens on 3 weeks after [Review 01]'s end
[Review 02 - 21 days] happens on 21 days after [Review 01]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>

So if you specify __Saturday__ and __Sunday__ as closed, a **week** will be equivalent to 5 days, as:
<plantuml>
@startgantt
Project starts 2021-03-29
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
[Review 01] happens at 2021-03-29
[Review 02 - 3 weeks] happens on 3 weeks after [Review 01]'s end
[Review 02 - 21 days] happens on 21 days after [Review 01]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>

__[Ref. https://forum.plantuml.net/13434/gantt-milestone-bug?show=13449#c13449[QA-13434]]__


== Simplified task succession
It's possible to use the `+then+` keyword to denote consecutive tasks.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 14 days
then [Test prototype] lasts 4 days
then [Deploy prototype] lasts 6 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>

You can also use arrow `+->+`


<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 14 days
[Build prototype] lasts 4 days
[Prepare test] lasts 6 days
[Prototype design] -> [Build prototype]
[Prototype design] -> [Prepare test]
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Working with resources
You can affect tasks on resources using the `+on+` keyword and brackets for resource name.


<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Task1] on {Alice} lasts 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} lasts 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} lasts 1 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>

Multiple resources can be assigned to a task:


<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Task1] on {Alice} {Bob} lasts 20 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>

Resources can be marked as off on specific days:

<plantuml>
@startgantt
project starts on 2020-06-19
[Task1] on {Alice} lasts 10 days
{Alice} is off on 2020-06-24 to 2020-06-26
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Hide resources

=== Without any hiding (by default)

<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Task1] on {Alice} lasts 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} lasts 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} lasts 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} lasts 1 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>


=== Hide resources names

You can hide ressources names and percentage, on tasks, using the `+hide ressources names+` keywords.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
hide ressources names
[Task1] on {Alice} lasts 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} lasts 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} lasts 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} lasts 1 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>

=== Hide resources footbox

You can also hide ressources names on bottom of the diagram using the `+ hide ressources footbox+` keywords.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
hide ressources footbox
[Task1] on {Alice} lasts 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} lasts 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} lasts 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} lasts 1 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>

=== Hide the both (resources names and resources footbox)

You can also hide the both.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
hide ressources names
hide ressources footbox
[Task1] on {Alice} lasts 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} lasts 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} lasts 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} lasts 1 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Separator

You can use `+--+` to separate sets of tasks.


<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Task1] lasts 10 days
then [Task2] lasts 4 days
-- Phase Two --
then [Task3] lasts 5 days
then [Task4] lasts 6 days
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Complex example
It also possible to use the `+and+` conjunction.

You can also add delays in constraints.


<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 13 days and is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
[Test prototype] lasts 9 days and is colored in Coral/Green and starts 3 days after [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] lasts 5 days and ends at [Prototype design]'s end
[Hire tests writers] lasts 6 days and ends at [Write tests]'s start
[Init and write tests report] is colored in Coral/Green
[Init and write tests report] starts 1 day before [Test prototype]'s start and ends at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Comments

As is mentioned on link::commons#560kta2oz3a2k362kjbm[Common Commands page]:
> Everything that starts with `+simple quote '+` is a comment.
>
> You can also put comments on several lines using `+/'+` to start and `+'/+` to end.
__(i.e.: the first character (except space character) of a comment line must be a `+simple quote '+`)__


<plantuml>
@startgantt
' This is a comment

[T1] lasts 3 days

/' this comment
is on several lines '/

[T2] starts at [T1]'s end and lasts 1 day
@endgantt
</plantuml>


== Using style

=== Without style (by default)
<plantuml>
@startgantt
[Task1] lasts 20 days
note bottom
  memo1 ...
  memo2 ...
  explanations1 ...
  explanations2 ...
end note
[Task2] lasts 4 days
[Task1] -> [Task2]
-- Separator title --
[M1] happens on 5 days after [Task1]'s end
-- end --
@endgantt
</plantuml>


=== With style

You can use link::style-evolution[style] to change rendering of elements.

<plantuml>
@startgantt
<style>
ganttDiagram {
	task {
		FontName Helvetica
		FontColor red
		FontSize 18

__Thanks for style for Separator and all style for Arrow (thickness...)__

=== Clean style

With style, you can also clean a Gantt diagram __(showing tasks, dependencies and relative durations only - but no actual start date and no actual scale)__: 
<plantuml>
@startgantt
<style>
ganttDiagram {
  timeline {
    LineColor transparent
    FontColor transparent
 }
}
</style>

hide footbox
[Test prototype] lasts 7 days
[Prototype completed] happens at [Test prototype]'s end
[Setup assembly line] lasts 9 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
then [Setup] lasts 5 days
[T2] lasts 2 days and starts at [Test prototype]'s end
then [T3] lasts 3 days
-- end task --
then [T4] lasts 2 days
@endgantt
