== Standard Library

This page explains the official Standard Library (`+stdlib+`) for PlantUML.
This https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib[Standard Library] is now included in official releases of PlantUML.
Including files follows the C convention for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library["C standard library"].

Contents of the https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib[library] come from third party contributors. We thank them for their useful contribution!


== List of Standard Library

You can list standard library folders using the special diagram:

<plantuml>
@startuml
stdlib
@enduml
</plantuml>

It is also possible to use the command line `+java -jar plantuml.jar -stdlib+` to display the same list.

Finally, you can extract the full standard library sources using `+java -jar plantuml.jar -extractstdlib+`. All files will be extracted in the folder `+stdlib+`.

Sources used to build official PlantUML releases are hosted here https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib[https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib]. You can create Pull Request to update or add some library if you find it relevant.

The Amazon Labs AWS library provides PlantUML sprites, macros, and other includes for Amazon Web Services (AWS) services and resources.

Used to create PlantUML diagrams with AWS components. All elements are generated from the official https://aws.amazon.com/fr/architecture/icons/[AWS Architecture Icons] and when combined with PlantUML and the https://c4model.com/[C4 model], are a great way to communicate your design, deployment, and topology as code.

The Elastic library consists of https://www.elastic.co[Elastic] icons.
It is similar in use to the AWS and Azure libraries (it used the same tool to create them).

Use it by including the file that contains the sprite, eg: `+!include elastic/elastic_search/elastic_search>+`.
When imported, you can use the sprite as normally you would, using `+<$sprite_name>+`.

You may also include the `+common.puml+` file, eg: `+!include <elastic/common>+`, which contains helper macros defined.
With the `+common.puml+` imported, you can use the `+NAME//OF//SPRITE(parameters...)+` macro.

| `+orig+`
| https://materialdesignicons.com[Material Design Icons]

|===

This library consists of a free Material style icons from Google and other artists.

Use it by including the file that contains the sprite, eg: `+!include <material/ma_folder_move>+`.
When imported, you can use the sprite as normally you would, using `+<$ma_sprite_name>+`.
Notice that this library requires an `+ma_+` prefix on sprites names, this is to avoid clash of names if multiple sprites have the same name on different libraries.

You may also include the `+common.puml+` file, eg: `+!include <material/common>+`, which contains helper macros defined.
With the `+common.puml+` imported, you can use the `+MA_NAME_OF_SPRITE(parameters...)+` macro, note again the use of the prefix `+MA_+`.

Example of usage:

<plantuml>
@startuml
!include <material/common>
' To import the sprite file you DON'T need to place a prefix!
!include <material/folder_move>

MA_FOLDER_MOVE(Red, 1, dir, rectangle, "A label")
@enduml
</plantuml>

**Notes:**

When mixing sprites macros with other elements you may get a syntax error if, for example, trying to add a rectangle along with classes.
In those cases, add `+{+` and `+}+` after the macro to create the empty rectangle.

Example of usage:

<plantuml>
@startuml
!include <material/common>
' To import the sprite file you DON'T need to place a prefix!
!include <material/folder_move>

MA_FOLDER_MOVE(Red, 1, dir, rectangle, "A label") {
}

There are sprites (\*.puml) and colored png icons available. Be aware that the sprites are all only monochrome even if they have a color in their name (due to automatically generating the files). You can either color the sprites with the macro (see examples below) or directly use the fully colored pngs. See the following examples on how to use the sprites, the pngs and the macros.

Use it by including the file that contains the sprite, eg: `+!include <font-awesome/align_center>+`.
When imported, you can use the sprite as normally you would, using `+<$sprite_name>+`.

You may also include the `+common.puml+` file, eg: `+!include <font-awesome/common>+`, which contains helper macros defined.
With the `+common.puml+` imported, you can use the `+NAME_OF_SPRITE(parameters...)+` macro.

Example of usage:

<plantuml>
@startuml
!include <tupadr3/common>
!include <tupadr3/font-awesome/server>
!include <tupadr3/font-awesome/database>

**Warning: We are thinking about deprecating this library. **

So you should probably use `+<awslib>+` instead (see above).

The AWS library consists of Amazon AWS icons, it provides icons of two different sizes (normal and large).

Use it by including the file that contains the sprite, eg: `+!include <aws/Storage/AmazonS3/AmazonS3>+`.
When imported, you can use the sprite as normally you would, using `+<$sprite_name>+`.

You may also include the `+common.puml+` file, eg: `+!include <aws/common>+`, which contains helper macros defined.
With the `+common.puml+` imported, you can use the `+NAME_OF_SPRITE(parameters...)+` macro.

Example of usage:

<plantuml>
@startuml
!include <aws/common>
!include <aws/Storage/AmazonS3/AmazonS3>

AMAZONS3(s3_internal)
AMAZONS3(s3_partner,"Vendor's S3")
s3_internal <- s3_partner
@enduml
</plantuml>
