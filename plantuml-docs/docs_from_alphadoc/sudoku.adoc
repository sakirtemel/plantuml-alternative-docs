== Have a break: resolve a Sudoku...

Sometimes, when modeling, it's good to have a break....

You can use **PlantUML** to create http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku[Sudoku], like in the following example:

<plantuml>
@startuml
sudoku
@enduml
</plantuml>
The sudoku is randomly generated.

It is also possible to generate a specific http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku[Sudoku] by providing its seed:

<plantuml>
@startuml
sudoku 45azkdf4sqq
@enduml
</plantuml>
