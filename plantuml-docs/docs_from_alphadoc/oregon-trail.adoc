== The Oregon Trail

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_%28series%29[Oregon Trail] is a __very old__ game created
in 1971.

A version from http://www.atariarchives.org/bca[David Ahl's] (named as
http://www.atariarchives.org/bca/Chapter02_WestwardHo.php[Westward Ho!] for some reasons)
has been ported to Java and integrated in **PlantUML**...

This page is dedicated to:

== Let's play

To launch the game, you will have to use the good old `+RUN+` Basic command :
<plantuml>
@startuml
run oregon trail
@enduml
</plantuml>

Every input has to be added in the text file:

<plantuml>
@startuml
run oregon trail
150
@enduml
</plantuml>

Every input has to be added in the text file:

<plantuml>
@startuml
run oregon trail
150
100
10
40
40
4
@enduml
</plantuml>

For shooting, you will have to type **as fast as possible**
the word printed on the screen (__like in the original version!__).

<plantuml>
@startuml
run oregon trail
150

Good luck to you on the __Oregon Trail__ !
