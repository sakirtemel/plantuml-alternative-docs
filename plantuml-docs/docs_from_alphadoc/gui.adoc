== PlantUML GUI
If the double-click does not work fine, you can try the following command:

----
java -jar plantuml.jar -gui
----

You can then select a directory that will be periodically
scanned by **PlantUML**.

Alternatively you can specify the source directory as part of the command:
----
java -jar plantuml.jar -gui /source/directory 
----

The following window lists all images that are generated by **PlantUML**.
If any modification is done in the directory, the window will be updated.

You can iconify the window while you are creating or changing
files into the chosen directory.

You can also double-click on an image title to have a look at it.
If the source file of the diagram is modified, the image will be
automatically updated.
