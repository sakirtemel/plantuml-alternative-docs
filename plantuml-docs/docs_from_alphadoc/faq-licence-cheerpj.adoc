== PlantUML going serverless

You'll find more information on https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-core[github].


== Does the standard CheerpJ Non Commercial Licence allow me to do non-commercial purposes such as non-commercial applications or internal technology evaluation?

Yes, you can perform technical evaluations using the CheerpJ AOT compiler and linking the
CheerpJ Runtime hosted on the Leaning Technologies Limited cloud.

However, according to https://leaningtech.com/cheerpj-non-commercial-licence/[this licence], you CANNOT have commercial use of your product
using the CheerpJ AOT compiler.


== So what does the __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__ allow in addition?

This dedicated licence allows you to distribute the library "plantuml-core.jar.js" which has
been built by CheerpJ AOT compiler with your own library.

It ONLY applies to the official `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` file distributed on PlantUML website, and
must be used alongside the CheerpJ Runtime hosted on the Leaning Technologies cloud.

So you can build your own library based on `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` and distribute it, as long as
you integrate the text of the __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__ in your own licence.

This __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__ grants specific rights as End User Licence Agreement:

* Evaluation of your library.
* Non commercial use of your library.
* Internal use of your library within your organization without any commercial use or publication of the output created with your library.

To benefit from this special licence, you must display the message "Powered by CheerpJ, a Leaning Technologies Java tool" and the CheerpJ logo somewhere in the page that is running thanks to your library.


== So can I install and use `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` on the intranet (internal network) of my organization?

Yes, as long as you are running it for internal usage only and that you do not have a
commercial use of the output created with your library and that you do not publish the output
created with that tool.

You must also ensure that the message "Powered by CheerpJ, a Leaning Technologies Java tool" and the CheerpJ logo is visible for end users.


== And can I install and use some third-part library or product that depends on `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` inside my organization?

Yes, as long as you are running it for internal usage only and that you do not have a
commercial use of the output created with this third-part library and that you do not publish
the output created.

You must also ensure that the message "Powered by CheerpJ, a Leaning Technologies Java tool" and the CheerpJ logo is visible for end users.


== Can I build some software that uses `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` directly or through some third-part library and sell it?

No, you cannot. This is a commercial usage which is not covered by the __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__. If you would like to do so, you have to request for a dedicated licence from Leaning Technologies Limited at mailto:sales@leaningtech.com[sales@leaningtech.com].


== Can I self-host the CheerpJ Runtime instead of having to use the runtime hosted by Leaning Technologies?

If you want to host a self-hosted CheerpJ Runtime, you will need to request a dedicated licence from Leaning Technologies Limited at mailto:sales@leaningtech.com[sales@leaningtech.com].


== Can I provide a service on the Internet which would be running thanks to `+plantuml-core.jar.js+`?

To be able to do so, your service must be open sourced by some license recognized by the
Open Source Initiative (OSI).

Your service must also be completely free and not intended for any commercial usage.

And finally, you must also ensure that the message "Powered by CheerpJ, a Leaning Technologies Java tool" and the CheerpJ logo is visible for all end users on all pages that run thanks to CheerpJ.


== Can I patch or modify the `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` file and use this new library according to the __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__?

No, you cannot. The __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__ ONLY applies to the beta and official releases provided by PlantUML.

Still, you can retrieve official PlantUML Java sources and use the CheerpJ AOT compiler to build your own `+plantuml-core.jar.js+` file. But you MUST NOT modify those Java sources if you want the CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence to be applied.


== Can I add another `+.jar.js+` file to my own library and benefit from the CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence?

No, you cannot. The __CheerpJ for PlantUML Licence__ ONLY applies to the beta and official releases provided by PlantUML.


== Is there any information sent to Leaning Technologies or PlantUML when I use the runtime?

No, nothing is sent from your browser. Everything is generated locally. The runtime is hosted on a CDN which cannot receive any data.
