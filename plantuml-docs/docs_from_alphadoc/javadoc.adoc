== New Doclet
A new enhanced doclet (written by Gerald Boersma) is now available.

It has much more option than the legacy previous one.

You will find https://github.com/gboersma/uml-java-doclet[detailed instructions here.]



== Legacy Javadoc
When the javadoc tools build the documentation, it copies all files
included in the `+doc-files+` directory to the javadoc . (see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html[How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool]).

You can take advantage of this feature like this:

----
package net.demo1;
/**
* Demonstration for PlantUML.
* <p>
* Example of use:
* <p>
* <img src="doc-files/image1.png">
*/
/*
* @startuml doc-files/image1.png
* Bob -> Alice : hello
* Alice --> Bob : OK
* @enduml
*/
public class Demo1 {

}
----

If you run **PlantUML** before the Javadoc, it will generate `+image1.png+`
in the directory `+doc-files+` .

Then, when you launch the Javadoc tool, you will have the following result:

image::javadoc01.png[]

Note that the definition of the image itself is in a non-javadoc
comment, so that it is not exported to HTML.

As you can see, adding UML diagrams into java documentation is now really easy.
