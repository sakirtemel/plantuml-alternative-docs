== Vote for your syntax!

We do not want to force users to learn some new syntax for this wiki.

So this website will __transparently__ allow users to use their preferred syntax.

Right now, only three syntaxes are (partially) supported:
* link::syntax-asciidoc[Asciidoc syntax]
* link::syntax-dokuwiki[Dokuwiki syntax]
* link::syntax-markdown[Markdown syntax]

You can vote to choose which others syntaxes should also be supported.

You just have to click on one vote button:

* vote::asciidoctor[I vote for AsciiDoc Syntax] (**Already working**)
* vote::confluence[I vote for Confluence Markup]
* vote::creole[I vote for Creole syntax]
* vote::dokuwiki[I vote for DokuWiki syntax] (**Already working**)
* vote::markdown[I vote for Markdown syntax] (**Already working**)
* vote::mediawiki[I vote for MediaWiki syntax]
* vote::pandoc[I vote for Pandoc syntax]
* vote::restructuredtext[I vote for reStructuredText syntax]
* vote::another[I vote for another syntax] __(Please update the pool in that case or use the post-it to indicate which syntax you're thinking of)__

(Tooltips on vote buttons display vote results.)
