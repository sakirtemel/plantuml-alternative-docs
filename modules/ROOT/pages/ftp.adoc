== File Transfer Protocol

`+FTP+` is normally used to transfer files.

However, it is possible to used this protocol to **generate** UML diagrams.

The way is to launch PlantUML is FTP mode: it runs as a mock FTP server.
You can upload text files to this server. Then, diagrams will be automatically generated in this FTP server.
You will just have to download the image files from the FTP server.

To start the ftp server, just launch the following command line:
----
java -jar plantuml.jar -ftp
----
By default, the server runs on the 4242 port, but you can specify another port:

----
java -jar plantuml.jar -ftp:12345
----
You can then connect to `+127.0.0.1+` on this port with any FTP client, using any user/password.

The FTP server implementation is really simple: you cannot create subdirectory, you cannot rename files...
You can only delete files.

Actually, this is not a __real__ FTP server. Nothing is stored on disk, everything runs in memory.

You can check http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/397629/Codeuml-design-UML-diagrams-as-fast-as-you-can-cod[codeuml] to have an example of running application.

The advantage of this approach is that you can easily integrate PlantUML with any application, if that application can handle FTP.

This may be simplier than launching a Java process for each diagram transfer.
