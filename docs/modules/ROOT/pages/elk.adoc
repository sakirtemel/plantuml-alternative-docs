== Eclipse Layout Kernel

PlantUML uses an external layout engine for some diagrams (classes, use cases...). By default, GraphViz/dot is used. This means that PlantUML has to call an external process to generate some diagrams.

There are some work in progress to change this behavior. For example, https://plantuml.com/smetana02[a port of GraphViz to Java] is ongoing.


Recently, https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/hal[Hallvard TrÃ¦tteberg] teaches us on how to use https://www.eclipse.org/elk/[Eclipse Layout Kernel] as https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/534[a library to process the layout].

This is still alpha-software, but results are very interesting. This is working starting from `+V1.2021.5+`.


== Usage

ELK is distributed as an independent library. So you have to build it yourself, or you can download http://beta.plantuml.net/elk-full.jar[the complete jar file here]. 

Both `+plantuml.jar+` and `+elk-full.jar+` have to be in the very same folder. You cannot rename elk-full.jar

Once installed, you can invoke ELK instead of GraphViz with the `+!pragma layout elk+` directive.

**Example:**

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
!pragma layout elk

package image {
	package color {
		class red
		class green
		
		red->green : red to green
	}
	package size {
		class big
		class small
	}
	class image1
	class image2
	image1 <|-- image2 
	
	size -> color : link between packages
}

class foo
class bar

foo -> bar : foo to bar
image1 "1" -> "*" bar
@enduml
----

This diagram is generated using ELK.

You can use the `+-P+` link::command-line[command-line] option to specify the pragma, rather than putting it in the puml file:
----
java -jar plantuml.jar -Playout=elk
----
__[Ref. https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/582[issue-582]]__

Do not expect too much right now, this is really an alpha-version. The idea is to get https://forum.plantuml.net/13709/eclipse-layout-kernel[feedback] from users, to know if we should continue in this direction (that is, supporting ELK within PlantUML).

Still, you can test link::class-diagram[class diagram] and link::deployment-diagram[deployment diagram] and https://forum.plantuml.net/13709/eclipse-layout-kernel[tell us what you think about the result].
