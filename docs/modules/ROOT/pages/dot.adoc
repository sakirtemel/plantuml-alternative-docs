== Generalisation

**PlantUML** now can generate diagrams other than UML. In such cases the usual `+@startuml+` does not make sense anymore. So now we allow diagrams start with `+@startXYZ+` and finish with `+@endXYZ+`, where `+XYZ+` can change with the type of diagram and can be any characters (including spaces).

> This means that plugin developers are encouraged to change their code to recognize `+@start+` instead of `+@startuml+`.

DOT diagrams are usually formatted as `+@startdot...@enddot+`.


== DOT

You can use the http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html[DOT language] to create directed graphs (see a http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php[Gallery of examples]).
(Note: **PlantUML** uses http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz/DOT] for layout of UML diagrams anyway.)

This allows you to use Graphviz/DOT with all tools that support **PlantUML**.

You can use `+@startdot/@enddot+` or `+@startuml/@enduml+` to delineate the diagram,
and then the very first line has to be: `+digraph XYZ {+`.

Here are some examples:
[source, plantuml]
----
@startuml
digraph foo {
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
@enduml
----

[source, plantuml]
----
@startuml
digraph foo {
 PlantUML -> Dot [label=use];
}
@enduml
----
