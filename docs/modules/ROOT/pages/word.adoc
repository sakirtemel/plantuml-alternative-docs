== Word Add-in
Adriaan van den Brand has made many improvements to the Word Add-in.

He has created a Word Template that allows a very good integration between __Word__ and PlantUML and better performance.

With this Word Add-in, a new bar will be available within Word:

image::word_bar1.png[]

By click on __"Preferences"__, you can now choose to use EPS instead of PNG for diagrams to improve print quality
(because EPS is a vector image format.)

This template allows using PlantUML directly from __MS Word 2010__ without need to alter document templates
or edit VBA macro's. __MS Word Versions 2007__ and __2013__ might work, but are not tested.

Everything is documented in the template itself, that you can

Many thanks for his works!

The macro searches the `+plantuml.jar+` file in that order:

* In the same directory as your document
* Then, in the parent directory of this directory
* Then, in the parent directory of the parent... up to the root folder
* Then, in the same directory as the `+normal.dot+` file
* Then, in the parent directory of this directory
* Then, in the parent directory of the parent... up to the root folder

If the `+plantuml.jar+` file is not found, a box display the list of all searched directories.
