== PlantUML in a nutshell

**PlantUML** is a component that allows you to quickly write:

* link::sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram]
* link::use-case-diagram[Usecase diagram]
* link::class-diagram[Class diagram]
* link::object-diagram[Object diagram]
* link::activity-diagram-beta[Activity diagram] (here is link::activity-diagram-legacy[the legacy syntax])
* link::component-diagram[Component diagram]
* link::deployment-diagram[Deployment diagram]
* link::state-diagram[State diagram]
* link::timing-diagram[Timing diagram]

The following non-UML diagrams are also supported:

* link::json[JSON data]
* link::yaml[YAML data]
* link::ebnf[Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) diagram]
* link::nwdiag[Network diagram (nwdiag)]
* link::salt[Wireframe graphical interface or UI mockups (salt)]
* link::archimate-diagram[Archimate diagram]
* link::activity-diagram-beta#sdl[Specification and Description Language (SDL)]
* link::ditaa[Ditaa diagram]
* link::gantt-diagram[Gantt diagram]
* link::mindmap-diagram[MindMap diagram]
* link::wbs-diagram[Work Breakdown Structure diagram (WBS)]
* link::ascii-math[Mathematic with AsciiMath or JLaTeXMath notation]
* link::ie-diagram[Entity Relationship diagram (IE/ER)]

Furthermore:
* link::link[Hyperlinks and tooltips]
* link::creole[Creole]: rich text, emoticons, unicode, icons
* link::openiconic[OpenIconic icons]
* link::sprite[Sprite icons]
* link::ascii-math[AsciiMath mathematical expressions]

Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language. (link::guide[see PlantUML Language Reference Guide]).

New users can read the link::starting[quick start page]. There is also a link::faq[F.A.Q. page]. PlantUML can be used within link::running[many other tools].

Images can be generated in PNG, link::svg[in SVG] or link::latex[in LaTeX] format. It is also possible to generate link::ascii-art[ASCII art diagrams] (only for sequence diagrams).
