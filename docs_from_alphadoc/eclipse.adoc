== Information about the PlantUML Eclipse Plugin


The Eclipse Plugin is developed and maintained by
http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/hal[Hallvard Tr√¶tteberg]
(many thanks for his work!).

Like the core library PlantUML itself, it is __open source__ and the plugin is distributed under EPL license.

The source code https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml[is hosted on GitHub].




== How to use it?
First, you have to display the __PlantUML View__ (click the __Window__ menu):

This view displays automatically the class you are working on:

If you write some comment in __PlantUML language__, the corresponding diagram is automatically displayed.
And if you have several comments with diagrams, it selects the one the cursor is in.

In the __Preferences__ Windows, you can also set up link::graphviz-dot[GraphViz path if needed]:

== How to install it?


To install the plugin, you have to:
* Go to **Help/Software Update/Find and install...** or **Help/Install new software...**
* Create (if needed) or choose the following site as update site: `+http://hallvard.github.io/plantuml/+`+++<br>+++image::eclipse101.png[]
* Select PlantUML features:+++<br>+++image::eclipse102.png[]
* Restart Eclipse


== How to improve it?

The plugin is not limited to Java source file, it also works with __Ecore____/Xcore__
files.

So that you can see the corresponding class diagram in a view side-by-side the __Ecore____/Xcore__
editor :

If you want to support other file types, you can implement a new extension to do so.
You can have a look at
https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/tree/master/net.sourceforge.plantuml.xcore[the current xcore implementation].
